### == PURPOSE & USAGE ==

Run srun.x11 with the usual sbatch arguments, but DO NOT give a program to run.
When your job starts, you'll find yourself using an interactive shell which has
proper X11 forwarding enabled.

for example on **farm**
```
srun.x11 -p bigmemh --mem 32000
### run R

### inside R console
